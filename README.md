### What is this? <a name="whatisthis"></a>
This is my [Manager README](https://hackernoon.com/12-manager-readmes-from-silicon-valleys-top-tech-companies-26588a660afe). It is intended to introduce who I am, what I do, what I value at work and some expectations on working together. I also hope to spread what I consider to be some good ideas. The intended audience is primarily engineers who report to me but I hope others find it helpful. This document is not a replacement for actually getting to know each other. We will get to know each other more in person.

There are two reasons for writing this:
1. Help me identify and refine my values and beliefs.
2. Help you understand me better so that we can work well together.

This document is a work in progress (so am I!). I appreciate feedback on both the content and the structure of the document. Your feedback will not only help me, but others who read this document in the future. Did you find it valuable? Did you read something here that is not consistent with my behaviors? Any other feedback? I want to know. You can even submit a Pull Request!

> Disclaimer:
> This document does not apply to anyone else in the company, and solely reflects on my personal management style.

### About me <a name="aboutme"></a>
- I was born in Bosnia and lived in Germany during elementary school. My family moved to Kentucky when I was twelve. I speak English, Bosnian, and German.
- In 2014, I moved to Nashville.
- I’m married to my wife Sakiba. We've been happily married since 2010. We have a son named Ali. He was born in 2020.
- Things that I like to do outside of work:
  * Spend time with family and friends
  * Enjoy good food and coffee. I go to a lot of restaurants and coffee shops. At home, I do quite a bit of grilling and cooking.
  * Watch TV shows and movies
  * Exercise. Primarily running, walking, and hiking.
  * Swim in or hang out by the pool
  * Travel. Warm places with beaches and big cities are my favorite destinations.
  * Play video games. Primarily sports simulations.
  * My favorite hobby is soccer. I've been a fan of [Bayern Munich](https://fcbayern.com/) since I was ten. I can watch or talk about soccer all day long. I follow other sports like Hockey, Basketball, and American Football as well.
- The three things that I value the most in my life are: 1. Health, 2. Family, 3. Work
- Check out my [one-page resume](https://app.enhancv.com/share/8840f661) if you want to get an overview of what I've done professionally so far.
- I’m interested in learning about you and sharing more about me!
- <img src="images/family.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

### What is my job? <a name="myjob"></a>
- Hire, develop, and retain top engineering talent.
- Build and continuously improve an incredible team.
- Plan our work.
- Remove roadblocks.
- Collect and share context.

I serve you, not the other way around. Let me know how I can help!

#### How do I measure if I'm successful? <a name="measuremysuccess"></a>
- Retention of the engineers that report to me.
- Growth and promotions of the engineers that report to me.
- Feedback from my direct reports, my peers, and my manager.
- Engagement surveys.
- My team's impact on business metrics.
- Absence of my team's involvement in incidents.

#### Some things that I think I'm pretty good at <a name="good"></a>
- ***I empower people.*** I don't micromanage and I'm not authoritative. I trust people to do the job that they were hired to do.
- ***I'm attentive.*** I listen and observe to find problems, find things to improve, and to recognize good work.
- ***I'm empathetic.*** I care deeply about my direct reports, other team members, and our users. I try to put myself in other people's shoes.
- ***I'm genuine.*** My communication is not very polished. But I'm honest and I speak from my heart.
- ***I'm driven.*** I don't procrastinate and I'm generally on top of my todo list. I have a bias for action, so if you need something from me you can count on me taking action on it in a timely manner.
- ***I understand what it takes to build good teams.*** That includes hiring the right people, putting in place good processes, and building good team cohesion.
- ***I understand what it takes to build good software.*** That includes among other things: process, architecture, design, and code. I've done backend, frontend, and even some infrastructure development in the past. You can bounce technical designs off me and I will ask questions and offer suggestions to help you come up with a good design. I'm a lot better at this than a [rubber duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/).

#### Some things that I'm not good at yet (there are others) <a name="notgood"></a>
- ***I'm not as good at written communication as I'd like to be.*** This is something that I'm working on.
 
### What do I value at work? <a name="values"></a>
- ***Teamwork:*** _I believe that software development is a team sport. Only a team of people can build something great. I believe that a good team should be greater than the sum of its parts. For that to be true the team needs among other things: the right mix of skills/diverse backgrounds/seniority, excellent collaboration, and team members who genuinely care about each other._
  * What you should take from this:
     * Build deep relationships with your teammates. Get coffee/lunch, go for a walk, talk about other things besides work.
     * Put the team first. If the team succeeds, it is highly likely that you will too.
- ***Ownership:*** _I value people taking ownership of their work end to end and operating as [Directly Responsible Individuals](https://medium.com/@mmamet/directly-responsible-individuals-f5009f465da4)._
  * What you should take from this:
       * Take the initiative to complete the task, feature, or project that you own. If you get blocked, be proactive and give an honest attempt to unblock yourself first. If you're still blocked, escalate to me or your teammates. If your work has a due date, and you are not able to meet it for whatever reason, communicate to me and your stakeholders as early as possible so that we can adjust plans accordingly.
- ***Impact:*** _I believe that code has value if it’s in production and helps people._ 
  * What you should take from this:
    * When working on a project, make sure that you understand how this project is going to help the user. Then optimize for helping the user.
    * While both of these are very important, the first is more important: Build the right thing, Build the thing right.
    * Measure whether your code helps users by reviewing metrics and / or gathering feedback.
- ***Continuous improvement:*** _Teams and individuals should continuously get even better. I believe in the saying “If you’re not getting better, you’re getting worse.”_
  * What you should take from this:
    * Invest time in your self-reflections during performance check-in periods, and think about how you can get even better.
    * Be engaged in our team retrospectives. They are an important tool that helps make our team even better.
    * Seek out training opportunities like online courses, books, and conferences. I might require additional approvals, but I will default to yes if you want training.
    * You should provide and be receptive to feedback (see Feedback section below).
- ***Transparency:*** _This builds trust which is critical to long term success on any team. There may be times that the company requires me to not share certain information, but I will never lie to you._
   * What you should take from this:
     * I'm sharing this document in part because I value transparency.
     * I would like you to be transparent with me and your teammates.

### Working together <a name="workingtogether"></a>
#### Onboarding <a name="onboarding"></a>
- I will prepare an onboarding document for you. I will try to make it as comprehensive as possible. 
- As you go through it, please take notes of things that are not clear or missing and share those notes with me. This will help me make the onboarding document even better for the next person who joins the team.
#### Communication <a name="communication"></a>
- Nothing in my job is more important than being available to you. In addition to the 1-on-1s I describe below, you can contact me at any time (including after hours) if you need to talk — face to face, video call, phone, text, Slack, or email.
- I choose to check my email and Slack in the evenings and on weekends sometimes. I do not expect you to do the same.  If I email or Slack you after hours, I don't expect you to reply until regular working hours. If I Slack you outside of work hours I will start the message with [not urgent].  The only time that I expect you to be available 24 x 7 is when you're on-call.
- You should reply to your emails at least once a day. And you should reply to direct Slack mentions within a few hours. If you are paged during on call you should respond immediately.
- You should overcommunicate and push relevant information to me and your teammates. Pushing information is a lot more efficient than us having to pull it.
- If you have a question for me or one of your teammates ask yourself "Would others benefit from an answer to this question?". If so, ask it in a setting where others would get the answer (Slack channel, email, meeting).
- If a Slack thread gets to ~50 messages, it's probably time to move it to a face to face conversation or video call.
#### Meetings <a name="meetings"></a>
- I prefer to minimize the amount of time you spend in meetings and maximize time spent doing [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692). However, some meetings are necessary. 
- The meeting organizer should clarify the purpose of each meeting with a clear subject and description/agenda on the invite. If someone invites you to a meeting and the purpose is not clear, you should feel empowered to ask them to clarify ahead of time. 
- If the purpose is clear and you feel that you would not add or get any value from the meeting, you should feel empowered to skip it. 
- When you're in a meeting you should avoid using your phone or laptop unless it's to make the meeting more productive ("Be present or be absent").
- If a meeting is scheduled to make a specific decision, let's agree on who the ultimate decision-maker (for example: PM, Designer, Tech Lead, Engineering Manager) is first in case we don't get to consensus. That will help us avoid endless debates and get to a decision promptly.
- There should always be one or more takeaways from every meeting. These can be decisions or action items (which should always have an assignee and a target date!). If there isn't a clear takeaway, the meeting was probably a waste of time.
#### 1-on-1s <a name="1on1s"></a>
- 30 minutes every week by default. Let me know if you prefer a different frequency, duration, day of the week/time of day, or location (Coffee in the break room? Coffee at a nearby coffee shop? Private meeting room?).
- These are for you. They are a safe space to talk about anything you want. It does not have to be work-related. To make them productive, please come up with some topics each week and add them to our agenda doc. I will do the same.
- As much as possible, we should avoid talking about the status of deliverables, as those are already communicated in standups and weekly project syncs.
- Some common topics:
  * Give each other positive and constructive feedback. Read more on feedback below.
  * Talk about anything that you would not be comfortable bringing up in a public setting. 
  * What are your short and long term career goals? What actions do you need to take to achieve those goals? How can I help?
  * What's going well? What could be better?
  * If you feel there are any problems on the team, big or small, I like to know early so that I can address them right away. Specific examples of things that are not going well will help me come up with actionable tasks. Bringing up possible solutions is even better.
  * We can work through problems (technical or non-technical) together.
 - If there are things that worked well for you with your previous manager let me know and I'll incorporate them!
 - Occasionally, we'll do a retrospective on our 1-on-1s to make them even better: What's going well? What's not going well? What should we start/stop doing?
#### Feedback <a name="feedback"></a>
I believe that feedback is a gift that helps us grow. Our company does formal performance feedback twice a year. But we should give each other feedback much more frequently. Your formal performance feedback should never be a surprise.

- Positive and constructive feedback is equally important.
- Feedback should be timely, specific, and actionable. It should always be aimed at specific behaviors and not a person. 
- I will give you regular feedback, and ask that you give me feedback as well. I want to improve just like you. 
- Our 1-on-1s are a good setting to give each other feedback. But the more timely ("in the moment") feedback is given, the more effective it will be. We don't have to wait for 1-on-1s.
- Three things are required for people to continue to give each other feedback. Please let me know if I’m doing poorly on any of these attributes. I’ll return the favor!
  * Safety (you should feel safe to give and receive candid feedback)
  * Effort (neither you nor I should feel defensive about the feedback)
  * Benefit (giving/receiving feedback should have an impact)
- I prefer to recognize people for specific good work that they did publicly. For example: with an email to the team, a shout out at an all-hands, or using our internal recognition tool. This gives visibility to your good work and encourages others to emulate the same behaviors. Let me know if you are not comfortable with public recognition, and I will do it privately. I will always provide constructive feedback in private only.
- If you have feedback for your peers it will be most effective if you provide it directly to them. If you're not comfortable let me know and I will provide it. 
- If you have feedback for me that you're not comfortable sharing, please tell my manager!

##### Want to know where you stand outside of the formal performance check-in conversation?
Performance reviews are a lot of work. They include you writing a self-reflection, peers providing feedback, managers calibrating, and managers writing reviews and assigning ratings. We will do that twice a year.

However, I can always provide you with a simplified "Green/Orange/Red" rating. Just ask. Because we'll be giving each other feedback frequently, these should never be a surprise.

- Green: You're doing well. Nothing to worry about.
- Orange: You're doing some things well, but you need to improve in at least one area to meet expectations for your level.
- Red: You're not meeting expectations for your level. You will need to improve significantly to meet expectations.

#### Work-Life Balance <a name="wlb"></a>
I believe in work-life balance and will try to model it. You should take time off periodically to have fun and recharge. This will benefit both you and the company in the long term.

#### Software Development Process <a name="process"></a>
Every team is different so there is no magic bullet when it comes to process. We should reflect often on our process in team retrospectives and continuously make it even better. Having said that, there are some things that I believe in, and that have worked well for me in the past. These are a good start.

- As a guiding principle, we should keep the process as light as possible to minimize unnecessary overhead and cognitive load. Think "Minimum Viable Process."
- We need very few standing meetings:
  * ***Planning:*** We should plan for at least one week's worth of work at a time. We should write our goals for the week down. Either in Jira or a doc. Goals motivate us, keep us focused, and keep us accountable. They also provide transparency to stakeholders into what we're working on at all times.
  * ***Standup:*** We need to have daily updates on what progress was made, what the plan is for the day, and if there are any roadblocks. This ensures that we have frequent and good communication on the team. These standup updates can be live or asynchronous in Slack.
  * ***Backlog Grooming:*** We need a periodic meeting to manage our backlog of work requests. Otherwise, our Jira project will become unmanageable.
  * ***Retrospective:*** We need a periodic team retrospective to discuss what's going well, what's not going well, and to create action items for getting even better as a team.
- I believe that building awesome things comes from incremental improvements over time. I find myself bothered by proposals for large changes with broad surface areas when there are alternatives to make small, scoped, and tactical changes that can be layered upon each other to reach the same or better outcomes. 
- I am a big fan of lean development principles, which I would summarize as: working in small batches, validating assumptions, and iterating.
- Large batches increase complexity and slow development down. A general rule of thumb: if your Pull Request is larger than 2 days of work, or if your task is more than 2 days long, your batch is likely too large. You should break the task down.
- Get things to production early and often. Code that doesn’t make it to production is waste. Early code in production (with the right feature flags of course) reduces risk and shortens the feedback loop.
- When working on any non-trivial task, you should design your solution first before writing any code. I believe that 80% of engineering effort should be spent on design, and 20% should be spent on code. This will help you complete the task faster and reduce the chance of bugs and missing support for edge cases.
- I'm a big fan of pair programming. It leads to better quality code due to constant code review, spreads knowledge on the team, and the task gets done faster.

#### Other Expectations <a name="otherexpectations"></a>
- Read our company's career pathways doc. Make sure that you understand the expectations for your role (ask me if you have any questions). Then do your job as defined by those expectations.
- Make sure you have clear and aligned goals. The task you work on should be aligned with your team’s goals. And your team’s goals should be aligned with company goals. Let me know if you ever feel that this is not the case, as it may be my fault and something that I need to correct.
- Be focused. As an engineer, most of your time should be [deep work](https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692). The more deep work hours you can get every day, the more productive you will be. When you code, you are most effective after you’ve been doing it for around 30 minutes with no distractions. When you get distracted for a few minutes, it takes almost the same amount of time to get in the flow again. Maximize the amount of continuous-time that you are “in the zone" and you will do your best engineering work. Here are two tools that have helped me increase my deep work:
  * [Clockwise](https://www.getclockwise.com/) - Optimizes your calendar so that you have the most uninterrupted time possible.
  * [Pomodoro Technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) - A time management method that helps you focus deeply on tasks. I use this [browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/marinara-pomodoro%C2%AE-assist/lojgmehidjdhhbmpjfamhpkpodfcodef?hl=en).
- Do the simple things very well. Many things in Software Development are complex. For example, accounting for every single edge case during testing. But some things fall into the simple category. We should consistently get 100% on the simple things.
  * Test code locally before deploying to staging, test code in staging before deploying to production, and monitor code in production after a deployment.
  * Be on time to meetings.
  * Respond to production incidents promptly when you're on call.
  * Pull work proactively.
- Have a [bias toward action](https://www.heinzmarketing.com/2009/09/bias-for-action/). If you are struggling to choose between two or more options, and the decision is reversible, pick one and start executing.
- If you break something, it’s okay. But you should own it and take the lead on fixing it.
- I make mistakes. Let me know when I do. And challenge me when you disagree.

### More about me <a name="moreaboutme"></a>
#### My Personality <a name="personality"></a>
As part of a team-building event, I took the [16 Personalities](https://www.16personalities.com/) test. I'm generally skeptical of personality tests such as this, as I believe that humans are much more complex than 16 broad types could cover. They don't tell the whole story. But I do agree with most of my results. Reading my results may help you understand me a little bit better.
- My personality code is ESFP-T and my personality type is Turbulent Entertainer. You can see my full 16 Personalities results [here](https://www.16personalities.com/profiles/442faeb4193ff).
- A few key callouts:
  * I don't spontaneously break out into song, dance, or acting. I don't do those things at all.
  * I do agree that I'm:
    * More Extraverted than Introverted: _"Extraverted individuals prefer group activities and get energized by social interaction. They tend to be more enthusiastic and more easily excited than introverts._"
    * More Observant than Intuitive: _"Observant individuals are highly practical, pragmatic and down-to-earth. They tend to have strong habits and focus on what is happening or has already happened._"
     * More Feeling than Thinking: _"Feeling individuals are sensitive and emotionally expressive. They are more empathic and less competitive than Thinking types, and focus on social harmony and cooperation._"
     * More Prospecting than Judging: _"Prospecting individuals are very good at improvising and spotting opportunities. They tend to be flexible, relaxed nonconformists who prefer keeping their options open._"
     * More Turbulent than Assertive: _"Turbulent individuals are self-conscious and sensitive to stress. They are likely to experience a wide range of emotions and to be success-driven, perfectionistic and eager to improve._"

#### Quirks <a name="quirks"></a>
All people have personality quirks. And so do I. Here are some things that I am both aware of, and that may impact how you work with me:
- I am an [External Thinker](https://coachapproachministries.org/thinking-styles/). To form an opinion on a topic, or come up with a solution to a problem, I often talk through it out loud with someone to refine my thoughts. I process information as I talk. I may say things to "see how they fit" before I commit to an opinion or propose a solution. If it's not clear whether I'm still processing or if I'm done, please ask.
- Because I believe in over-communication and pushing information (rather than others having to pull it), I tend to repeat myself. If there is something important that I want to get across, such as feedback or context, I may use multiple channels (1-on-1s, team meetings, email, Slack) and say it more than once to make sure everyone gets the message.
- I'm a [glass half full](https://https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is_the_glass_half_empty_or_half_full%3F) person and tend to look at things positively. I think that I developed this outlook to better deal with certain difficulties that I've had in life. A positive outlook can be a good thing in life and at work, but it is possible that sometimes I can miss the fact that something is truly bad. Let me know if you think that is happening.

#### Triggers <a name="triggers"></a>
Some things that I don't like:
- Endless debates. What is "too long" depends on the complexity of the topic and the reversibility of the decision. If I believe that a debate has gone on for too long, I will identify the ultimate decision-maker and ask them to decide so that we can move forward.
